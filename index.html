          <h1>The Human Colossus Foundation</h1>
          <h5>Synergy for the future</h5>
          <hr>
        </div>

	<p>We entered a new age of civilization where technology and data
	brings us progress and value. Helps us to fly to the moon, explorer
	universe, understand nature surrounding us but as well help to cure
	cancer, keep people alive, educated them, give purpose and meaning in
	life - information is our most precious resource. To be able to use
	that information for good we need to steer the emerging ecosystem in
	the right direction towards prosperity, freedom, fair and educated
	society.  </p>
	<p>Our vision is to leverage emerging decentralized data economy
	around user centric services, data aggregation, self sovereign identity
	and distributed trust frameworks to improve existing infrastructure and
	build businesses on new models.</p>
	<p> We need synergy within the ecosystem not only on the level of human beings but
	especially on the organizational level.  </p>

	<p>To put words into action, we established a non-profit foundation in Switzerland - as a relatively neutral ground with solid privacy regulations. The foundation is a home for all of the collaborative work which Colossus would do and through it we would share with and support different types of organization to build together a better world. </p>

	<h2>Tribute</h2>
	<p>Why Human Colossus? The idea was born after reading an article on
	the topic of Brain-Machine interfaces by 
	<a href="https://www.lifestyleupdated.com/2017/11/20/concept-human-colossus/">
		Tim Urban
	</a>
	, he coined the concept of the Human Colossus helps to explain the progress of our civilization.

	<pre>
When language came into existence, ideas, experiences and
knowledge started to transfer and then accumulate. Hence, the
Human Colossus was born â€“ the analogy of a collective organism
comprised of billion cells, each represented by a single
person.

	<h2>Decentralized Data Economy</h2> 
	<p>Decentralized Data Economy (DDE)
	is a new way to look on the ecosystem which emerge from usage of data
	in connection with digital world. The Human Colossus Foundation's main
	goal is to faciliate creation of DDE and supporting comunities,
	businesses and individuals to being able to take part into new economy
	on equal and fair rights. We identify few main components which we
	would focus on to make that happen: </p>
